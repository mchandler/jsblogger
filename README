This is a demo RUBY ON RAILS app developed during a training course. There
really isn't much to it. If you'd like to try it out or mess around with it,
simply clone the project and migrate the database on the command line:

rake db:migrate

When that is complete, start the server

rails server

Navigate to http://localhost:3000
